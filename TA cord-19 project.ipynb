This might be associated with our small number of cases and short delivery time (ie, as soon as possible after diagnosis). ~~TAG~~ Previous studies have shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection in infants born to mothers who had SARS infection during pregnancy. ~~TAG~~ 18, 20 One neonate in our study was infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. However, the viral nucleic acid tests of the placenta and cord blood in this patient were negative for SARS-CoV-2, so intrauterine vertical transmission might not have occurred; thus, further study is needed.

Five women had ongoing pregnancy without severe obstetrical complications at the time of manuscript preparation. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. ~~TAG~~ Therefore, the obstetrical outcomes from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear better than that for pregnant women with SARS. ~~TAG~~ However, it's worth noting that most pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester in this study.

       "44  The severity of viral pneumonia in pregnancy is evidently related to physiological and immunological changes that result in a shift from cell-mediated to humoral-mediated immunity [7] . When pregnant women become infected with viral pneumonia, they are more likely to have complications and progress to severe cases [8] . A study in Hong Kong in 2004 shows that SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction [9] . ~~TAG~~ Another study shows that pregnant women with pneumonia have an increased risk of developing low birth weight infants, preterm births, restricted fetal growth, and 5-minute Apgar score <7 compared to healthy pregnant women [10] . ~~TAG~~ Although there have been no clinical or serological reports of SARS or MERS in neonatal infections in existing studies [9, 17] , evidence of vertical motherto-child transmission in other respiratory viruses such as H1N1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been reported [11] . There have been several studies concerning intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 and its effects on newborns [12, 13] . All the newborns of COVID-19 infected mothers in these cases were negative for nucleic acid test and one study shows that COVID-19 may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death [13] .

This could be happening in lung tissue, facilitating ACE2 expression, as observed during lung cancer and COPD. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, we determined whether ACE-2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. Factors considered in our analysis are the end date of the outbreak, the total number of cases, economic impact, and students' graduation. these parameters vary considering the heterogeneity of the population, location of virus transmission, and socio-economic and political factors [Rabajante, .                                                                                                                 \n",

All of the provinces outside Hubei were included in the analysis of demographic characteristics, key time-toevent intervals, incubation period, and serial interval. Increasingly, epidemiological studies are performed in real-time during an outbreak to understand key metrics such as the epidemic's reproduction number, serial interval distribution, incubation period and risk of international spread 2,3. In simplest terms, the reproductive number of a disease is a function of its transmission rate and the duration of infectious period.   \n",

Of these patients, 55 (24.9%) were severe patients and 166 (75.1%) patients were non-severe (Table 1). Lymphopenia was common in patients with COVID-19 and SARS patients, and can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis. Patients at older age and with medical comorbidities are at the most risk of requiring hospitalization, ICU care, and at risk for death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
